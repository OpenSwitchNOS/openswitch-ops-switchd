/**
 * Asic Plugin
 *
 *  SwitchD Plugin Infrastructure includes two types of plugins:
 *
 * - Asic plugins: are plugins that implement the platform dependent asic code.
 *   There can be only one asic plugin loaded in the system. The asic plugin
 *   must implement all the functionality defined in asic_plugin.h. The plugin
 *   infrastructure will enforce that the asic plugin meets the major and minor
 *   versioning numbers specified in the asic_plugin.h file to guard against ABI
 *   breakage.
 *
 * - Feature plugins: are plugins that implement feature code that is
 *   indenpendent of the asic. A feature plugin can export public functions for
 *   other plugins or the main switchd code to use. A feature plugin will define
 *   its plublic interface with a major and minor number for versioning. The
 *   plugin infrastructure will provide methods to find and access the feature
 *   plugin interfaces; it will also validate that the requested major and minor
 *   numbers against the feature plugin public interface.
 *
 *   For asic plugins versioning is enforced by the plugin infrastructure based
 *   on the required version in asic_plugin.h file. For feature plugins
 *   versioning is enforced by the plugin infrastructure based on the exported
 *   plugin interface.

/** @struct asic_plugin_interface
 *  @brief asic_plugin_interface enforces the interface that an ASIC plugin must
 *  provide to be compatible with SwitchD Asic plugin infrastructure.
 *  When an external plugin attempts to register itself as an ASIC plugin, the
 *  code will validate that the interface provided meets the requirements for
 *  MAJOR and MINOR versions.
 *
 *  - The ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_NAME identifies the registered interface as an
 *  ASIC plugin. All asic plugins must use the same interface name. The plugin
 *  infrastructure will enforce that only one asic plugin can be registered at a
 *  time. Asic plugins from vendors will have different names but they will
 *  register the same interface name.
 *
 *  - The ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MAJOR identifies any large change in the fields
 *  of struct asic_plugin_interface that would break the ABI, so any extra
 *  fields added in the middle of previous fields, removal of previous fields
 *  would trigger a change in the MAJOR number.
 *
 *  - The ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MINOR indentifies any incremental changes to the
 *  fields of struct asic_plugin_interface that would not break the ABI but
 *  would just make the new fields unavailable to the older component.
 *
 *  For example if ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MAJOR is 1 and
 *  ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MINOR is 2, then a plugin can register itself as an
 *  asic plugin if the provided interface has a MAJOR=1 and MINOR>=2. This means
 *  that even if the plugin provides more functionality in the interface fields
 *  those would not be used by SwitchD. But if the plugin has a MAJOR=1 and
 *  MINOR=1 then it cannot be used as an asic plugin as SwitchD will see fields
 *  in the interface struct that are not provided by the plugin.
