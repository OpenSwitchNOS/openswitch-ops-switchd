#ifndef RECONFIGURE_BLOCKS_H

/* Reconfigure Blocks allows an external SwitchD plugin to register callback
 * handlers to be triggered at several different points in the reconfigure
 * bridge event. This enables the external plugin to be able to listen and make
 * changes at different points in the bridge reconfigure logic.
 *
 * Once a change in the switch configuration is detected (by a change in the
 * OVSDB sequence number), the Bridge reconfigure function can be broken down in
 * the following segments:
 *
 * - Update Bridge and VRF ofproto data structures, nothing is pushed down the ofproto layer
* - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_BRIDGE_INIT>
 * - At bridge_init entry point
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_INIT_RECONFIGURE>
 * - For each bridge delete ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_BR_DELETE_PORTS>
 * - For each Vrf delete ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_VRF_DELETE_PORTS>
 * - Applies delete changes to ofproto layer
 * - For each bridge delete or reconfigure ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_BR_RECONFIGURE_PORTS>
 * - For each vrf delete or reconfigure ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_VRF_RECONFIGURE_PORTS>
 * - Create and push new bridge and vrf ofproto objects to ofproto layer
 * - For each bridge add new ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_BR_ADD_PORTS>
 * - For each vrf add new ports
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_VRF_ADD_PORTS>
 * - For each updated port of a bridge
 * - <BLK_BR_PORT_UPDATE>
 * - Configure features like vlans, mac_table
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_BR_FEATURE_RECONFIG>
 * - For each updated port of a vrf
 * - <BLK_VRF_PORT_UPDATE>
 * - For each configured port in a vrf add neighbors
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_VRF_ADD_NEIGHBORS>
 * - For each vrf reconfigure neighbors and reconfigure routes
 * - <RECONFIGURE ENTRY POINT BLK_VRF_RECONFIGURE_NEIGHBORS>
 *
 * The callback handler will receive a blk_params struct as a parameter which
 * holds references to the global bridge configuration, OVSDB IDL handle, current
 * bridge instance being process and current vrf intances being process.
 * Current Bridge and Vrf instance members are only valid in the blocks
 * they are called from.
 *
 * blk_params.br member is only valid in the blocks:
 *   BLK_BR_DELETE_PORTS, BLK_BR_RECONFIGURE_PORTS, BLK_BR_ADD_PORTS,
 *   BLK_BR_FEATURE_RECONFIG
 *
 * blk_params.vrf member is only valid in the blocks:
 *   BLK_VRF_DELETE_PORTS, BLK_VRF_RECONFIGURE_PORTS, BLK_VRF_ADD_PORTS,
 *   BLK_VRF_ADD_NEIGHBORS, BLK_VRF_RECONFIGURE_NEIGHBORS
 *
 * blk_params.port member only valid in the blocks:
 *   BLK_BR_PORT_UPDATE, BLK_VRF_PORT_UPDATE
 *
 * Reconfigure Blocks API
 *
 * register_reconfigure_callback: registers a plugin callback handler into a specified block.
 * This function receives a priority level that is used to execute all registered callbacks
 * in a block in an ascending order (NO_PRIORITY can be used when ordering is not important
 * or needed).
 *
 * execute_reconfigure_block: executes all registered callbacks on the given
 * block_id with the given block parameters.
