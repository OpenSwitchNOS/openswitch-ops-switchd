/** @struct copp_asic_plugin_interface
 *
 * @brief copp_asic_plugin_interface enforces the interface that an COPP_ASIC
 * plugin must provide to be compatible with SwitchD Asic plugin
 * infrastructure.  When an external plugin attempts to register itself as an
 * COPP_ASIC plugin, the code will validate that the interface provided meets
 * the requirements for MAJOR and MINOR versions.
 *
 *  - The COPP_ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_NAME identifies the registered interface as
 *  an COPP_ASIC plugin. All asic plugins must use the same interface name. The
 *  plugin infrastructure will enforce that only one asic plugin can be
 *  registered at a time. Asic plugins from vendors will have different names
 *  but they will register the same interface name.
 *
 *  - The COPP_ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MAJOR identifies any large change in the
 *  fields of struct copp_asic_plugin_interface that would break the ABI, so
 *  any extra fields added in the middle of previous fields, removal of
 *  previous fields would trigger a change in the MAJOR number.
 *
 *  - The COPP_ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MINOR indentifies any incremental changes
 *  to the fields of struct copp_asic_plugin_interface that would not break the
 *  ABI but would just make the new fields unavailable to the older component.
 *
 *  For example if COPP_ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MAJOR is 1 and
 *  COPP_ASIC_PLUGIN_INTERFACE_MINOR is 2, then a plugin can register itself as
 *  an asic plugin if the provided interface has a MAJOR=1 and MINOR>=2. This
 *  means that even if the plugin provides more functionality in the interface
 *  fields those would not be used by SwitchD. But if the plugin has a MAJOR=1
 *  and MINOR=1 then it cannot be used as an asic plugin as SwitchD will see
 *  fields in the interface struct that are not provided by the plugin.
